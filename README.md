Common Issues and Solutions with GiftCardMall/MyGift Balance
While the MyGift platform is generally reliable, there are a few common issues users may encounter when trying to check their balance or activate a card. Here are the most common problems and how to resolve them:

Incorrect Card Information
Double-check that you’ve entered the correct gift card number and PIN. If the numbers are not input correctly, the system won’t be able to retrieve your balance.
